## What is a postprocessing script?
A postprocessing script modifys the gcode generated by the slicer. These scripts allow to add functions, which are not available in slicers.
Often times these scripts are universally working or can be easily adapted to work with different slicers gcode. It's simpler to write a postprocessing script, than implementing it in the slicer directly.

## Overview of scripts:
-  limit_reatrctions: limit exessive retractions, to reduce failed prints (especially useful for high retraction distance)
-  min_fan_speed: set a minimum fan speed setting
-  optimised_timelapse: perfecting the timelapse, by taking the picture at the same location every layer
-  pre_sliced_gcode: modify gcode to suit your printer
-  anti_elephantfoot: reduce elephant foot and increasing dimensional accuracy
## How to run script from Slic3r/Prusaslicer/Orcaslicer:
go to print settings => output options => post processing scripts then enter your path to the python.exe and the python script like this: "C:\Users\bj\anaconda3\python.exe" "C:\Users\bj\OneDrive\Dokumente\CAD\Software\post_processing_gcode\min_fan_speed.py";
If you want to run the script from the slicer set ``run_in_slicer = True`` inside of the script.
If the slicer can't execute python you'll get the error: Win32 error 193
For debugging run the script in an IDE with a presliced gcode.
Use on your own risk!
