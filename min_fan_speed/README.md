This script changes the value of the fan speed to the number where it is actually spinning.
This prevents not cooling the layers when it's actually intended.
If the fan speed is set to 0 the program won't change that since it's intantually not spinning

I would recommend to test the program first to see that everything is working
Use at your own risk!
