This script changes the value of the fan speed to the number where it is actually spinning.
This prevents not cooling the layers when it's actually intended.
If the fan speed is set to 0 the program won't change that since it's intantually not spinning.
Often fans can spin at a low setting, but can't start at this setting. Therefore it needs to be accelerated with a higher fan speed first. Enable the add_blib function to do so.

I would recommend to test the program first to see that everything is working
Use at your own risk!
